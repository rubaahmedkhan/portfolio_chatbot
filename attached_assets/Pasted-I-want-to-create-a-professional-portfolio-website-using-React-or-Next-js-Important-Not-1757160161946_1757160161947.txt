I want to create a professional **portfolio website** using React (or Next.js).  

‚ö° Important Notes:  
1. The **images/screenshots** I provide are ONLY for **design reference** (colors, layout, sections).  
   ‚Üí Do NOT copy the text from those images.  
   ‚Üí Instead, use the actual text and details that I am providing below.  
2. The website must be responsive, modern, and professional with a dark theme + gradient highlights (similar to the reference images).  
3. Each section should be a clean component (Header, Home, About, Skills, Projects, Education, Contact).

### About Me Section
I am an AI Engineer with a background in Mathematics and a strong focus on Agentic AI systems. My passion lies in designing AI agents that can reason, use tools, and provide intelligent support across real-world domains.  

Over the past few years, I have worked extensively on projects in the education sector, where I leverage Agentic AI to build systems that guide students, generate personalized feedback, and connect learners with the right resources.  

I specialize in combining LLMs, RAG pipelines, and automation workflows to create scalable AI products. My work ranges from intelligent resume screening systems to EduConnect AI, an ongoing project that redefines how students interact with knowledge using Agentic AI.  

My long-term vision is to contribute as a specialist in Agentic AI, developing applications that make learning more accessible, personalized, and impactful.
